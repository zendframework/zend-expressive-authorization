## 0.2.0 - 2017-10-09

### Added

- [#8](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authorization/pull/8) adds
  support for http-interop/http-middleware 0.5.0 via a polyfill provided by the
  package webimpress/http-middleware-compatibility. Essentially, this means you
  can drop this package into an application targeting either the 0.4.1 or 0.5.0
  versions of http-middleware, and it will "just work".
